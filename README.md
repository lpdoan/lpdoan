- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lpdoan. People call me Phuong or Lucille.
- I graduated with a MSc in Finance and Data Science, but I have realized over the years that I really like coding more than finance !
- I'm working as an analytics intern, working on improving and refactoring some of the code in the company codebase.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in improving my python skills, and still learning web apps with Shiny.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data visualizaions with Python, R and Tableau.
